# **Game-Theoretic Control for Multi-Robot Racing**

### Motivation
Safe and efficient interaction with the environment requires an autonomous system
to understand the effects of its actions on the decisions of other agents in the scene.
State-of-the-art model-based optimal control approaches treat other agents as
dynamic obstacles and ignore their rational behavior. In contrast, game-theoretic
planning allows to model differing objectives of multiple agents explicitly. The goal of
this project is to implement both techniques and compare their performance in a
realistic simulated environment.
